The Best Vegetable Lasagna
Five reasons to love this recipe:

You can easily adjust the vegetables to suit the seasons or your pantry (see recipe notes).
The sauce is made from scratch with basic ingredients. It only takes a few minutes to make.
Use no-boil noodles and you donâ€™t have to bother cooking them. Just layer them up!
I recommend cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which has more protein and flavor (trust me).
You can even make this recipe gluten free and/or vegan. See the recipe notes for details.
